AUTHOR.  Michael Coughlan.
* Uses the ACCEPT and DISPLAY verbs to accept a student record 
* from the user and display some of the fields.  Also shows how
* the ACCEPT may be used to get the system date and time.

* The YYYYMMDD in "ACCEPT  CurrentDate FROM DATE YYYYMMDD." 
* is a format command that ensures that the date contains a 
* 4 digit year.  If not used, the year supplied by the system will
* only contain two digits which may cause a problem in the year 2000.
